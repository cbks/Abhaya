Hello
Abhaya is an effort to ensure the safety of women
If a woman wants to go to a certain place but feels unsafe, she can set an estimated time to reach the place manually or using google maps
If she reaches the place on time, the app will send a notification to her emergency contacts that she has reached safely
If she doesn't reach before the estimated time, a notification will be sent to user asking if she wants to send out an alert or not
If the user does not respond to the notification, an alert will be sent out by default to the emergency contacts and the nearest police station
If she encounters something unpleasant on the way, she can send out an SOS by pressing the power button twice
Additional features such as free self defence videos would also be provided in the app
